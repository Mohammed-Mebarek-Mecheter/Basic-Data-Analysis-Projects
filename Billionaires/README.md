# Billionaires Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project involved an in-depth analysis of data on billionaires spanning 1996 to 2014. The aim was to uncover insights and trends related to the wealth accumulation and demographics of billionaires over this time period.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/billionaires) source was the Forbes World's Billionaires list, which provided detailed information on billionaire rankings, wealth, demographics, company affiliations, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw data was contained in a CSV file named `billionaires.csv`. Initial data preprocessing steps included:

- Loading the CSV file into a Pandas dataframe
- Inspecting the columns and data types
- Handling missing values
- Fixing inconsistent data formats
- Creating new columns/features for analysis

## Wealth Analysis

The core analysis focused on examining trends in the total wealth accumulated by billionaires over time:

- Total wealth was aggregated by year to identify growth trends
- Highest and lowest wealth years were found
- Wealth fluctuations and outlier years were identified
- Wealth growth was analyzed across regions and sectors
- Statistical analysis was performed to quantify wealth patterns

Key findings revealed consistent upward trends in total billionaire wealth, with some regions and sectors rapidly outpacing others.

## Self-Made vs Inherited Wealth

Further analysis explored the proportion of self-made vs inherited billionaire wealth:

- A new column categorized billionaires as 'self-made' or 'inherited'
- Proportions were calculated for each category
- Role of gender and location was analyzed in wealth source

Results showed approximately 64% self-made and 36% inherited billionaires. Variations emerged across gender and locations.

## Conclusion

In summary, this project provided data-driven insights into the patterns, trends, and composition of billionaire wealth over nearly 20 years. The techniques used can serve as a template for similar data analysis projects.
