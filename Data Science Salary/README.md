   - Examine the dataset structure and columns.
   - Check for missing values and handle if needed.

2. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) of the dataset.
   - Create visualizations (histograms, box plots) to understand the salary distribution.

3. **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**
   - Check for missing values in the dataset.
   - Decide on appropriate strategies for handling missing values.
   - Identify outliers in the data using IQR method.
   - Determine whether to keep or remove outliers based on context.

4. **Visualizing & Analyzing the Distribution**
   - Visualize the distribution of salaries using histograms.
   - Analyze the distribution for patterns and fluctuations.

5. **Salary Trends Over the Years**
   - Group the data by years and calculate average salaries.
   - Create a line plot to visualize the trends over the years.
   - Interpret the findings regarding average salary growth and trends.

6. **Relationship Between Experience, Employment Type, and Salary**
   - Analyze the relationship between experience level, employment type, and salary using box plots and bar plots.
   - Interpret the visualizations to understand how these factors impact salary.

7. **Identifying High-Salary Job Titles Across Factors**
   - Group the data by experience level, employment type, and job titles.
   - Calculate average salaries for different combinations of factors.
   - Identify job titles that consistently offer higher salaries.

8. **Recommendation of Suitable Job Titles**
   - Based on desired salary range and experience level, filter the dataset.
   - Display suitable job titles that match the candidate's criteria.

## Conclusion
The project has involved data loading, preprocessing, exploration, visualization, and analysis of salaries. It has provided insights into salary distributions, trends, and relationships based on experience level, employment type, and job titles. The analysis can help candidates make informed decisions about suitable job titles based on their desired salary range and experience level.
