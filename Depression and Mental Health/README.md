# Depression and Mental Health Data Analysis

## Dataset Overview

The [RHMCD-20](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/depression-and-mental-health-data-analysis) dataset was used for the analysis, containing survey data related to depression and mental health. The dataset includes information from various demographics, such as age, gender, occupation, and responses to survey questions related to mental health indicators during quarantine.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Data Exploration

1. Checked the size of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
2. Explored the columns and their data types.
3. Checked for missing values and duplicates (none found).
4. Described the dataset to understand central tendencies and variability.

### Step 2: Exploring Demographics

1. Explored the distribution of participants across different age groups, genders, and occupations.
2. Analyzed the prevalence of specific mental health indicators by demographics.

### Step 3: Descriptive Analysis

1. Analyzed prevalent mental health indicators reported by participants.
2. Explored the distribution of the number of days participants spent indoors during quarantine.
3. Examined the impact of quarantine frustrations on mental health indicators.

### Step 4: Perceptions and Coping Mechanisms

1. Explored participants' perception of social interaction and support.
2. Analyzed coping mechanisms reported by participants during quarantine.

### Step 5: Analyzing Trends Over Time

1. Examined how the prevalence of mental health indicators has changed over time.
2. Investigated noticeable trends or patterns in the data.

### Step 6: Specific Inquiries

1. Calculated the proportion of participants reporting extreme mood swings.
2. Analyzed factors associated with a higher likelihood of extreme mood swings.

## Challenges Faced

- Dealing with categorical data and ensuring proper encoding.
- Identifying meaningful patterns in the data without causal inference.

## Conclusions

- Participants with higher levels of quarantine frustrations tend to report increased stress and changes in habits.
- Weight changes during quarantine are prevalent among participants, and further analysis by mental health history can provide insights.
- Extreme mood swings are reported by approximately 32% of participants.
- Coping struggles and changes in work interest and social weakness are prevalent among participants.
